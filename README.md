## Theme development

Thanks to [D3473R](https://github.com/D3473R) 💪🏼 for creating a development environment with Docker. From now on you can work on this theme without installing a Ghost instance on your local machine. With two commands you have an instant development setup and you can build the theme for production.

Please take a look to this page to see how it works: https://github.com/eddiesigner/liebling/wiki/Theme-development-with-Docker
